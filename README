This script will attempt to set up a BNEP network connection over bluetooth from your Linux device to a phone (or any other device that's operating as a Network Access Point.

It's very similar to what Network Manager does when you request a mobile broadband connection over bluetooth, except this doesn't need Network Manager, and is a lot less clever.

Enter your local Bluetooth MAC address in nap_connect.cfg as my_mac, and the destination Network Access Point MAC address as nap_mac

Execute ./nap_connect.py
