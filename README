This script will attempt to set up a BNEP network connection over bluetooth from your Linux device to a phone (or any other device that's operating as a Network Access Point. To do this, it uses DBUS to manipulate the BlueZ stack.

It's very similar to what Network Manager does when you request a mobile broadband connection over bluetooth, except this doesn't need Network Manager, and is a lot less clever.

First pair your client with the NAP device with ./simple-agent hci0 XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

Enter your local Bluetooth MAC address in nap_connect.cfg as my_mac, and the destination Network Access Point MAC address as nap_mac

Execute ./nap_connect.py

The goal of this script is to be able to use it as a pre-up script on Debian, for embedded and minimal systems to use Bluetooth as a Network transport layer
